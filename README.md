# Pricing4Java

Pricing4Java is a Java-based toolkit designed to enhance the server-side functionality of a pricing-driven SaaS by enabling the seamless integration of pricing plans into the application logic. The package provides a suite of components that are predicated on the Yaml4SaaS syntax, a specification that facilitates the definition of system's pricing and its features alongside their respective evaluation expressions, grouping them within plans and add-ons, as well as establishing usage limits.

Pricing4Java has been designed to be used with [Pricing4React](https://github.com/isa-group/Pricing4React), a frontend library that consumes the generated JWT and toggles on and off features based on the user pricing plan.
